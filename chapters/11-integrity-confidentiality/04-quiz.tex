    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is the primary role of a Certificate Authority (CA) in PKI?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To encrypt data for secure communication
        \item To generate private keys for end users
        \item To perform real-time certificate revocation checks
        \item \textbf{To issue and manage digital certificates}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is the primary security foundation of the RSA algorithm?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The difficulty of computing discrete logarithms
        \item The complexity of hash function collisions
        \item \textbf{The difficulty of factoring large composite numbers}
        \item The unpredictability of random number generation
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is a key characteristic of a cryptographic hash function?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{It generates a unique fixed-length output for any input}
        \item It produces a reversible output of fixed length
        \item It allows easy recovery of the input from the output
        \item It prioritizes speed over collision resistance

    \item Which statement best describes the computational efficiency of
          symmetric versus asymmetric cryptography?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Asymmetric cryptography is generally faster than symmetric for
              large data encryption
        \item \textbf{Symmetric cryptography is generally faster than asymmetric
              for data encryption}
        \item Both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography have similar
              computational speeds
        \item Symmetric cryptography requires more computational resources for
              key generation
    \end{enumerate}
