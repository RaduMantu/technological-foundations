\section{Overview}

Security and integrity are cornerstones of modern digital communication. Today,
it is a given that data transmission should remain confidential, authentic and
untampered. It is more common to worry about the security and confidentiality
of your data while in the possession of service providers, rather than during
its transit over public networks. Nonetheless, all public networks are
inherently considered untrusted. The reason why this is not a problem is due to
the use of a widely adopted cryptographic protocol named \textbf{Transport
Layer Security (TLS)}. This protocol uses \textit{digital certificates} to
establish trust in entities located across untrusted networks and establish
secure and confidential communication channels.

Before learning more about TLS, we first need to discuss about the cryptographic
primitives employed by this protocol and the \textbf{Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI)} that forms the foundation on which trust is established between entities
in the Internet.
