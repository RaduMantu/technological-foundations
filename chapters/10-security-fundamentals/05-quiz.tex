\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the primary purpose of threat modeling in cybersecurity?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To develop new software features securely
        \item \textbf{To identify, assess, and prioritize potential threats to a
              system}
        \item To encrypt sensitive data during transmission
        \item To monitor network traffic for intrusions
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is a key prerequisite for a buffer overflow attack to succeed?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The attacker must have physical access to the target system
        \item The system must be running on an outdated operating system with no
              patches
        \item The application must lack multi-factor authentication
        \item \textbf{The target program must fail to validate input size before
              copying it into a fixed-size buffer}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Which sanitizer is specifically designed to detect uninitialized
          memory read errors that could lead to exploitable vulnerabilities?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Thread Sanitizer
        \item Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
        \item \textbf{Memory Sanitizer}
        \item Control Flow Sanitizer
    \end{enumerate}

    \item How does a sanitizer like AddressSanitizer mitigate buffer overflow
          exploits in practice?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{By inserting guard zones around allocated memory and
              checking for accesses to these zones}
        \item By rewriting the binary to remove all buffer-related operations
        \item By enforcing mandatory access controls at the operating system
              level
        \item By converting all stack-based buffers to heap-based allocations
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is the primary role of seccomp in enhancing system security?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It encrypts system calls to prevent interception
        \item \textbf{It restricts the system calls a process can make, limiting
              its attack surface}
        \item It monitors memory allocation to prevent buffer overflows
        \item It enforces mandatory access controls on file operations
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
