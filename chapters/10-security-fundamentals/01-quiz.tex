\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the difference between a bug and a vulnerability?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{A bug is a coding error, a vulnerability is a bug that can
              be exploited}
        \item A bug is intentional, a vulnerability is accidental
        \item A vulnerability is always caused by hardware
        \item A bug cannot affect security
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What does the principle of "least privilege" mean?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Users should have no access at all
        \item All files should be encrypted
        \item \textbf{Users and programs should only get the minimum access they
              need}
        \item Only administrators can log in to a system
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is the main purpose of applying security patches?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To improve software speed
        \item To add new features
        \item To remove old code
        \item \textbf{To fix vulnerabilities and reduce exploit risk}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Which of the following is an example of social engineering rather than
          a technical exploit?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Buffer overflow
        \item Cross-site scripting
        \item \textbf{Phishing email}
        \item SQL injection
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What is the goal of "defense in depth"?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To use one strong security control
        \item \textbf{To layer multiple security measures for stronger
              protection}
        \item To eliminate the need for monitoring
        \item To use multiple encryption algorithms on sensitive data
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
